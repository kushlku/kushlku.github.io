## Projects
### End-to-End GenAI Entity Resolution Workflow, _2024-present_
Developed a scalable pay-as-you-go entity resolution workflow that integrates representation learning, entity matching, 
and generative AI to improve product variation curation and correction. Key innovations include: (1) applying nonparametric 
clustering as a lossless alternative to blocking to scale pairwise matching; (2) developing a performant, distilled, 
multimodal LLM matcher to estimate match probabilities; (3) leveraging efficient off-the-shelf LLM inference for 
cluster deduplication; and (4) pruning the clusterâ€“cluster graph to surface the most informative and uncertain edges. 
The new workflow was provably more efficient and achieved _99%_ precision and at least _90%_ recall 
with more than _5x_ reduction in human touchpoint. 

### Scalable Product Retrieval and Blocking Service, _2023-2024_
Built a scalable product retrieval service using multimodal CLIP-like models trained in a distributed setup. 
Optimized for large-batch contrastive learning, the models demonstrated strong generalizability across product 
types and product relationships, enabling task-agnostic retrieval and blocking for large-scale pairwise workflows. 
The service significantly outperformed baselines such as token-overlap based blocking system and enabled _95%_ recall
and efficient product retrieval using multimodal representations and approximate nearest neighbor search optimizations.
This work led to CIKM'24 publication titled [Unsupervised Multimodal Representation Learning for High Quality 
Retrieval of Similar Products at E-commerce Scale](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3583780.3615504) as an oral paper.

### Improve Recall of Product Attribute Extraction Models using Reinforcement Learning, _2022-2023_
Extended Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based single-attribute entity extraction to multi-attribute entity
extraction using a Transformer-based architecture that was more performant. This reduced the need to maintain separate 
models per product attribute and locale, creating an operationally efficient model-building pipeline and faster goal delivery.
Moreover, Transformer-based extraction models exhibited better context awareness for more accurate entity prediction based on
correlations with other entities, even when certain entity values were missing or noisy.

### Multi-Attribute Entity Extraction using Transformers, _2021-2022_
